                            <br/><br/><p>A quick question for you: how did you come into this world?</p>
                            <p>Did you;</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Get found on the side of the road?</li>
                              <li>Come into being inside a trash bin, where your parents picked you up?</li>
                              <li>Emerge from your mother's armpit?</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Now, none of these answers are true. But these are all answers that Chinese parents gave to their children when they were asked about their origins.</p>
                            <p>In 2012, the Chinese Central Television network went on the street to ask people how their parents handled this simple question. Many turned away and didn't answer, but a lot of the respondents reported answers similar to the above. </p>
                            <p>Sexual education in general remains a taboo topic in China, despite the Ministry of Education including sex education as part of schools' curriculums in 2008. In most schools, this amounts to giving children textbooks and telling them to read on their own. These textbooks often describe conception in the most clinical terms—sperm meets egg—without discussing sex. One of these textbooks, 'Happy Middle School Students' (快乐中学生) published in 2006, is still widely used.</p>
                            <p>The university student whose mother told her that she came from her mother's armpit said that she knew nothing about sex until college. She fully believed her mother for many years.</p>
                            <p>A Tsinghua University professor of sociology, Jing Jun, said that most people take their first true sexual education classes during university. But people become curious earlier than that: of sexually active university students, over half of them had their first sexual experience between the ages of 11 and 18. This early experimentation resulted in pregnancy in about 10 percent of cases.</p>

                            <p>It isn't even the lack of contraceptives that is the issue. Not knowing how to properly use different forms of birth control is a serious issue as well. A 2014 study found that about a quarter of girls under the age of 17 who have gotten pregnant were using birth control, and only about a fifth of people know how to properly use a condom.</p>
                            <p>In addition, many believe that abortion is an alternative to contraception. Especially in urban areas, the rate of terminated pregnancies is very high. Overall throughout China, about 30 percent of all pregnancies end in abortion. This number is likely to be a low estimate, given that many Chinese women go to unofficial clinics who advertise "painless abortions", and official numbers do not count non-surgical abortions.</p>
                            <p>This high abortion rate is in part due to a very strong gender preference for boys. Couples often pay for gender determination services, and more often than not it is a female that ends up aborted—despite gender preference not being a legal reason for government-provided abortion services. This was especially prevalent during the time when China's infamous One Child Policy was in place.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, risk of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) such as HIV are skyrocketing among the youth. According to the National Center for STD/AIDS Prevention and Control, the growth rate of HIV among young people is around 35 percent.</p>

                                <br/><p>A lack of sex education is certainly no problem specific to China. It is a topic hotly debated in the United States and across Europe, particularly the United Kingdom. In countries where HIV/AIDS is a significant problem, sex education is often a priority as well. If anything about sex education makes it to the news, it is often about a new initiative that goes forward because existing measures aren't enough, and often those new initiatives face a heavy amount of criticism, almost as if people believe sexual education is a topic that shouldn't be addressed. Take, for instance, <a href=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/08/health/china-sex-education-textbook-children/index.html>a recent controversy</a> regarding an elementary school textbook in China.</p>
                                <p>Is there a part of China's culture or society that particularly lends itself to creating this lack of sex education?</p>
                                <p>A possible reason for a lack of sex education is that parents themselves do not feel comfortable discussing this subject with their children, and are resistant to attempts made by schools. Many feel like discussing the subject with children can lead to a 'corruption' of youth—similar to other moral panics that have taken place in other countries. Many people who commented on the textbook—whose pages were shared on social media websites like Weibo—said that children may attempt to imitate the images that they saw in the textbook.</p>
                                <p>Referring to the above textbook discussion, one mother felt too embarrassed to read the textbook, believing it to be too graphic. </p>
                                <p>"Parents' refusal of sex education harms their children," says Li Yinhe, a sex educator and a sociologist, in a story <a href=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/08/health/china-sex-education-textbook-children/index.html>reported by CNN.</a></p>
                                <p>In some cases, parents feel as if sex education is a matter that should be left to schools. In other cases, they feel as if sex education is wholly unnecessary for children as sex is a matter for adults, and when their children grow up they will be able to know instinctively about sex.</p>
                                <p>But schools as well feel as if this is a matter too sensitive to <i>not</i> be taught by parents, and many thus leave sex education vague and clinical.</p>
                                <p>Part of this can be traced back to the strong belief in Confucianism, particularly its emphasis on asceticism. The tenets of Confucianism now still have a great impact on Chinese society, especially filial piety, and Confucianism's focus on restricting pleasure carries over to modern Chinese attitudes regarding romance and relationships. Many schools forbid students from dating, and many schools have students act as 'proctors', who report any students found to be publically engaging in displays of affection. Dating and relationships are also commonly seen as distractions from studying, and this contributes to an atmosphere where adolescents don't have the opportunity to safely explore questions about their sexuality.</p>

                      <br/><p>What is next for sex education and sexual health in China?</p>
                      <p>China's infamous One-Child Policy is ending in favor of a Two-Child Policy, primarily to combat the aging population and low fertility problems that are currently creating an enormous challenge for neighboring countries Japan and Korea.</p>
                      <p>A book by the Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies predicts that this will not cause a large increase in birthrates. But the government has considered providing monetary incentives for women who would have second children, and the lifting of the policy could encourage at least a few more people to start attempting to conceive.</p>
                      <p>The China Family Planning Association (CFPA) is then in charge of providing information to the populace on how to best prepare for and plan for childbirth. One part of their duties is evaluating the state of sex education in the country. A survey of 18,000 college students found that there were many areas that still required a lot of sex education.</p>
                      <p>However, there are many initiatives now that contribute to a better sex education environment in China. The divisive textbook mentioned above has sold out, and it has been praised as an inclusive and thorough coverage of the subject appropriate for the age range it is targeted at.</p>
                      <p>In addition, many Chinese youths are getting information not only from their school, or not only from their parents, but from the internet. This has been a source of concern to some, but there are many websites that are tailored specifically to provide age-appropriate content for young people who otherwise would not have the appropriate resources to learn about sex education.</p>
                      <p>Not only that, but there are multiple WeChat accounts that deal specifically with answering questions specifically raised by youths, and offering support for people who do not otherwise have it. Given how ubiquitous WeChat is in China, it provides an alternative way for people to get the information they need.</p>
                      <p>Classes of sex education involving parents also are becoming more commonplace. Research has shown that higher levels of parent involvement result in better quality of sex education, better familial relationships, and more open sexual beliefs that contribute to changing social attitudes regarding topics such as HIV-positive individuals and non-heterosexual people.</p>
                      <p>Things still aren't quite perfect for the state of sex education in China. But it is getting better and better by the day. It takes a lot of effort and initiative from people with the knowledge to spread, but it is helping.</p>
